 * Class containing all the packet identifiers used by the mod. This is

 * Custom packets are usually created when the mod needs to send data from
 * the server to the client or vice versa. This is usually done when the
 * mod needs to sync data between the server and the client and the data is
 * one that doesn't have a vanilla packet to handle it.
